## Advanced settings

### Getting your subscriptions from gpodder

By default, _Podcasts_ manages the subscriptions directly from your Garmin device, but optionally subscriptions you can download subscriptions from a gpodder.net account.

{% include note.html content="gpodder is an external project. More info at [gpodder.net](https://gpodder.net)" %}

To enable gpodder as the podcast provider, in the app settings (either in Connect IQ or directly on your watch), set **Subscription service** to _gpodder.net_. 
From Garmin Connect IQ app set your **Username** and **Password**. 

{% include note.html content="To login in gPodder use your **Username** not your email! You can find your username at gpodder.net under Settings/Account/Public Profile." %} <br>

</p>

### Downloading recent episodes automatically

Instead of selecting individual episodes each time you sync, _Podcasts_ can automatically download the most recent ones for each feed.

In the app settings (either in Connect IQ or directly on your watch), set **Sync Mode** to _Most Recent_ and select the number of episodes to download for each podcast using the **Episodes per Podcast** setting. 
To avoid long synchronizations, the numbers of episodes downloaded is limited to the **Max. Episodes** setting.
